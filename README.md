## What Is This?

 a program for users to catalog and organize their music. This could be a CD, vinyl or even a tape collection.

They should be able to create a new record, enter the record title, and list out all of their records.
Add a feature that allows users to add an artist to a record. Keep it simple â€” assume each is by a single artist.
After that, let users list out all the artists and choose an artist to see which records are by that artist.
All model logic should be thoroughly tested.

## How To Run This Project

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "ToDoList". 
3. Run `dotnet watch run` in the command line to start the project in development mode with a watcher.
4. Open the browser to _https://localhost:5001_. If you cannot access localhost:5001 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS.
